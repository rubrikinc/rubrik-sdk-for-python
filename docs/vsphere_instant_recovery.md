## Arguments
| Name        | Type | Description                                                                 | Choices |

| vm_name  | str  | The name of the VM to Instantly Recover. |         |
## Keyword Arguments
| Name        | Type | Description                                                                 | Choices | Default |
|-------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| date  | str  | The date of the snapshot you wish to Instantly Recover formated as `Month-Day-Year` (ex: 1-15-2014). If 'latest' is specified, the last snapshot taken will used.  |         |    latest     |
| time  | str  | The time of the snapshot you wish to Instantly Recover formated formated as `Hour:Minute AM/PM`  (ex: 1:30 AM). If 'latest' is specified, the last snapshot taken will be used.  |         |    latest     |
| host  | str  | The hostname or IP address of the ESXi host to Instantly Recover the VM on. By default, the current host will be used.  |         |    current     |
| remove_network_devices  | bool  | Flag that determines whether to remove the network interfaces from the Instantly Recovered VM. Set to `True` to remove all network interfaces.  |         |    False     |
| power_on  | bool  | Flag that determines whether the VM should be powered on after Instant Recovery. Set to `True` to power on the VM. Set to `False` to instantly recover the VM but not power it on.  |         |    True     |
| disable_network  | bool  | Sets the state of the network interfaces when the VM is instantly recovered. Use `False` to enable the network interfaces. Use `True` to disable the network interfaces. Disabling the interfaces can prevent IP conflicts.  |         |    False     |
| keep_mac_addresses  | bool  | Flag that determines whether the MAC addresses of the network interfaces on the source VM are assigned to the new VM. Set to `True` to assign the original MAC addresses to the new VM. Set to `False` to assign new MAC addresses. When 'remove_network_devices' is set to `True`, this property is ignored.  |         |    False     |
| preserve_moid  | bool  | Flag that determines whether to preserve the MOID of the source VM in a restore operation. Use `True` to keep the MOID of the source. Use `False` to assign a new moid.  |         |    False     |

## Returns
| Type | Return Value                                                                                   |
