## Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fix MSSQL Recovery Point timestamp validation on Windows OS Python 2 & 3 ([Issue 268](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/268))

## v2.0.10

### Added

- `get_sla_objects()` now also supports the following object types: hyper-v, mssql_db, ec2_instance, oracle_db, vcd, managed_volume, ahv, nas_share, linux_and_unix_host, windows_host ([Issue 226](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/226))
- `object_id()` now supports the `organization`, `organization_role_id`, `organization_admin_role`, and `mssql_availability_group` `object_type`
- Added `add_organization_protectable_object_mssql_server_host()` ([Issue 234](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/234))
- Added `add_organization_protectable_object_sql_server_db()` ([Issue 234](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/234))
- Added `add_organization_protectable_object_sql_server_availability_group()` ([Issue 234](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/234))
- Added additional regions to valid_(aws|azure) enums ([Issue 271](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/271))

### Changed

- The `create_sla()` function will return a more clear error message when the SLA was found on the Rubrik cluster but with a different configuraiton than the one provided. ([Issue 236](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/236))

### Fixed

- When calling create_sla() an error will not longer be thrown for frequencies and retentions that have a default None value provided ([Issue 232](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/232))
- The `object_id()` function now returns the correct the MSSQL DB and MSSQL Instance. When the object_type is `mssql_instance` the `mssql_host` keyword argument is now required. When the `object_type` is `mssql_db`, both the `mssql_instance` the `mssql_host` keyword arguments are required. 
- Added all examples to the `object_id()` documentation.
- Prevent an error from being thrown when passing in an integer value into the `params` keyword argument in the `get()` function ([Issue 239](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/236))
- Fix Azure CloudOn api failure by adding resource_id

## v2.0.9

### Added

- get_all_hosts()
- get_all_vcenters()
- Added a new `logging_level` argument to the Connect function that lets users choose which logging level they would like to show in their logs.

### Fixed

- `object_id` will return the ID for all cases using the database name and the database hosts for the `oracle_db` object type ([Issue 199](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/199)) 
- Fixed case-sensitivity for `object_id` ([Issue 216](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/216))
- Incorrect string join on `get_vsphere_vm` & `get_sql_db` trailing & in query ([Issue 221](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-sdk-for-python/issues/221))
